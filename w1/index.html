        My name is Jayden Fagre, I'm 21 years old and in my second term at NEIT. 
        I'm currently in the Software Engineering program and I'm enjoying it so far.
        I'm from a town in Rhode Island called Westerly. I've lived there my whole life.
        I'm a big fan of video games and I'm currently playing a lot of The Finals
