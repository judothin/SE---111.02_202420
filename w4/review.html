            <p>I first saw this movie on tiktok. I put the movie on mostly because I was bored and had nothing else to do. Also, Miles Teller ... cmon. I had no idea how good the movie would be. It definitely has a kind of cliff hanger ending in regards to if he gets his girl back or not but other than that the movie was far better than I anticipated. </p>
